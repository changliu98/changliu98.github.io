Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Syracuse University, fortunately advised by [Kristopher Micinski](https://kmicinski.com/).

My research interests focus on programming languages and machine learning, particularly in binary analysis, decompilation, logic programming. My previous work includes developing automated and scalable systems for binary analysis, investigating machine learning algorithms on binary similarity, and application of logic programming on program analysis. My expertise spans reverse engineering, logic programming, machine learning.
