I'm a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Syracuse University, it's my fortune to be advised by [Kristopher Micinski](https://kmicinski.com/).

My research focuses on programming languages, particularly in reverse engineering, compilers, and logic programming. Previously, I worked on developing automated and scalable curation systems for machine-executable datasets and benchmarking machine learning algorithms for binary analysis. I am crrently working on compilers and decompilation.
