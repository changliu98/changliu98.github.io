a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Syracuse University. It's my fortune to be advised by [Kristopher Micinski](https://kmicinski.com/).

My research explores the core principles of secure and verifiable programming, focusing on compilers and reverse engineering. I challenge a common assumption in the field: that compilation is an inherently information-lossy and irreversible process and my research develops methods to recover high-level abstractions directly from machine code.

To address this challenge, I have developed scalable systems for curating large datasets of machine executables and benchmarked machine learning algorithms on a range of binary analysis tasks. These works have been published in NeurIPS DB Track and is being actively used by the research community.

My expertise spans compilers (partilcarly CompCert and LLVM), logic programming, and the application of LLM on decompilation.
